#INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN

To run this script you will just need python installed on your computer, as well as hub, a wrapper for git that allows creation of PRs from command line.

To install hub, use homebrew: just run "brew install hub" from command line

To run the script simply run "python3 progenity.py -u=USERNAME -p=PASSWORD" replacing USERNAME and PASSWORD with your respective credentials.

Your credentials will not be stored, and will be deleted when the script has finished running.

If you would like to specify a branch name or filename other than the defaults ("test-pr" and "config.txt", respectively), you may do so by adding the "-b" and/or "-f" flags to the command.

Please refer to your email for the test account credentials.

Thank you for your time and consideration!
